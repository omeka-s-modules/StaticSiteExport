# Static Site Export

An [Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/) module for exporting static sites.

## End user notes

This section is meant for end users.

### Exporting a static site

After installing and configuring this module, go to an Omeka site in the administrative
interface, click on "Static Site Export" in the navigation, and click the "Export
new static site" button. After configuring the export, click the "Begin export"
button. The new export will be the first in the list. Click on the "Details" icon
for information about the export, including progress of the export job.

Note that an export may take a long time, depending on the size of the site.

### Building a static site

After exporting a static site, you can unzip the resulting ZIP file and immediately
use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build and view the static site:

```
$ cd /path/to/static-sites/
$ unzip <export-name>.zip
$ cd <export-name>/
$ hugo server
```

After the build is complete, follow the instructions and go to the specified web
server in your browser.

## Developer notes

This section is meant for developers. If you are using this module only to export
and build a static site, none of the following should apply to you.

### Modifying the Hugo theme

To modify the Hugo theme, first clone it in the module's data/ directory:

```
$ cd /path/to/omeka/modules/StaticSiteExport/data/
$ git clone git@github.com:omeka/gohugo-theme-omeka-s.git
```

It's not required, but we recommend that you clone the repository in the module's
data/ direcotry, alongside the theme's ZIP file. Here, Git will ignore the theme
directory so you don't accidentally commit it to the module repository.

After modifying the theme, make sure you update the theme's ZIP file before pushing
changes:

```
$ cd /path/to/omeka/modules/StaticSiteExport/data/
$ zip --recurse-paths gohugo-theme-omeka-s.zip gohugo-theme-omeka-s/ --exclude '*.git*'
```

Note that we're excluding the .git/ directory from the ZIP file.

### Adding vendor packages

Modules can add vendor packages (e.g. scripts, styles, images) by registering them
in module configuration:

```
'static_site_export' => [
    'vendor_packages' => [
        'package-name' => '/path/to/vendor/directory',
    ],
]
```

Where "package-name" is the name of the directory that will be created in the
static site vendor directory; and "/path/to/vendor/directory" is the absolute path
of the directory that contains all assets needed for the package. These assets will
be copied to the newly created static site vendor directory.

### Adding JS and CSS

To include JS on a page, add the JS path the "js" array on a page's front matter:

```
$frontMatter['js'][] = 'vendor/path/to/script.js';
```

To include CSS on a page, add the CSS path the "css" array on a page's front matter:

```
$frontMatter['css'][] = 'vendor/path/to/style.css';
```

These can be set in the bundle events (see below), or in various services (see below).

### Adding Hugo shortcodes

Modules can add Hugo shortcodes by registering them in module configuration:

```
'static_site_export' => [
    'shortcodes' => [
        'shortcode-name' => '/path/to/shortcode-name.html',
    ],
]
```

Where "shortcode-name" is the name of the shortcode; and "/path/to/shortcode-name.html"
is the absolute path of the shortcode file. These shortcodes will be copied to the
newly created static site directory.

### Using services to add content

Modules can add content to static sites via the provided services in module configuration:

- `['static_site_export']['block_layouts']`: Add site page block layouts (Hugo page content)
- `['static_site_export']['data_types']`: Add data types (Hugo page content)
- `['static_site_export']['file_renderers']`: Add file renderers (Hugo page content)
- `['static_site_export']['media_renderers']`: Add media renderers (Hugo page content)
- `['static_site_export']['navigation_links']`: Add naigation links (Hugo menu entries)
- `['static_site_export']['resource_page_block_layouts']`: Add resource page block layouts (Hugo page content)

These services are parallel to existing Omeka services, and have identical purposes,
but they are for static sites instead of Omeka sites. See the module configuration
file and the respective interfaces to see how to implement them.



### Events

Attach events to the shared event manager in `Module::attachListeners()`. For example:

```
$sharedEventManager->attach(
    'StaticSiteExport\Job\ExportStaticSite',
    'static_site_export.bundle.item',
    function (Event $event) {
        $job = $event->getTarget();
        $resource = $event->getParam('resource');
        $frontMatter = $event->getParam('frontMatter');
        /* Do something */
    }
);
```

In your handler, use `$event->getTarget()` to get the export job object, which
has methods that could be useful. Note that some parameters are `ArrayObject`s.
These you can modify and they will take effect without having to set them back on
the event.

#### Using events to add pages

Modules can add items, media, item sets, and assets via the following events:

- **static_site_export.ids.items**
    - `ids`: An array of item IDs added automatically
    - `addIDs`: An `ArrayObject` containing IDs of items to add
- **static_site_export.ids.media**
    - `ids`: An array of media IDs added automatically
    - `addIDs`: An `ArrayObject` containing IDs of media to add
- **static_site_export.ids.item_set**
    - `ids`: An array of item set IDs added automatically
    - `addIDs`: An `ArrayObject` containing IDs of item sets to add
- **static_site_export.ids.assets**
    - `ids`: An array of asset IDs added automatically
    - `addIDs`: An `ArrayObject` containing IDs of assets to add

You may add IDs using the `addIDs` parameter, like so:

```
$addIds = $event->getParam('addIDs');
$addIds[] = $asset->id();
```

#### Using events to modify page bundles

Modules can modify page bundles via the following events:

- **static_site_export.bundle.item**
    - `resource`: The item representation
    - `frontMatter`: An `ArrayObject` containing page front matter
- **static_site_export.bundle.media**
    - `resource`: The media representation
    - `frontMatter`: An `ArrayObject` containing page front matter
- **static_site_export.bundle.item_set**
    - `resource`: The item set representation
    - `frontMatter`: An `ArrayObject` containing page front matter
- **static_site_export.bundle.asset**
    - `resource`: The asset representation
    - `frontMatter`: An `ArrayObject` containing page front matter
- **static_site_export.bundle.site_page**
    - `resource`: The site page representation
    - `frontMatter`: An `ArrayObject` containing page front matter

You may modify Hugo page front matter using the `frontMatter` parameter, like so:

```
$frontMatter = $event->getParam('frontMatter');
$frontMatter['params']['myParam'] = 'foobar';
```

### Logging commands

The export job executes quite a few shell commands. These are not logged by default
because for large sites the log will likely grow to surpass the memory limit. For
debugging, modules can turn on command logging in module configuration:

```
'static_site_export' => [
    'log_commands' => true,
]
```
